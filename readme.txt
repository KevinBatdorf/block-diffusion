Run text prompts through various AI models using the Replicate cloud API.

== Description ==

A new era of content creation is here. With machine learning and advanced models, we are now capable of creating unique images based on text prompts alone. We are only lmiited by our imagination. Use artifical intelligence to unlock your creativity and wow your visitors.

This plugin interfaces with the Replicate API and allows you to run open-source models via their cloud API.

= Features =
- Stable Diffusion
- Reverse Image To Prompt (coming soon)
- AI Prompt Animation (coming soon)
- Face Restoration (coming soon)

= Pro version =
There are no plans to lock any features behind a pro or premium plugin. All features will be added to this version on wordpress.org. Over time I plan to add all features supported by Replicate, as well as additional features for the WordPress community specifically. If you are interested in helping support the development of this plugin, please [sponsor the project on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/KevinBatdorf).
